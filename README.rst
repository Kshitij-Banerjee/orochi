Orochi – 8tracks.com commandline client
=======================================

**Warning: Pre-Alpha!**

Orochi is a command line client for `8tracks.com <http://8tracks.com/>`__
written in Python.

Yamata no Orochi (八岐の大蛇) is a legendary 8-headed and 8-tailed Japanese
dragon. The name translates to "8-branched giant snake". I chose the name
because it both refers to the number eight (as in 8tracks) and to snakes (as in
Python).
